Command Overview:
...          
**Syntax:** 
- Commands are given in the following format:
$`command arg1 arg2 ...`
...
**Arguments:**
- Arguments are separated by spaces. If an argument contains spaces, enclose it in quotes.
$`command arg1 "arg two with spaces" {arg3:isAnObject} ?arg4=alsoAnObject [arg5,is,an,array]`
- Each argument can use the standard Element variable syntax to handle any data type.
...
**Element Variable Syntax Primer for Commands:**
- Special values: true false null undefined
- Special value aliases: . ! - ? are aliases for true false null and undefined respectively.
- Numbers: Integers and floats are supported just as they are, e.g. 123 and 1.23
- Strings: Enclose in " or ' if they contain spaces or are a special character, otherwise just as they are, e.g. "My Spaced String" and mystring both work.
- Arrays: Enclose in [] and separate elements with commas. Each element will be recursively parsed as a potential variable.
- Objects: Enclose in {} and treat like pseudo-JSON, e.g. {abc: 123}. OR prefix with a ? and use query string formatting e.g. ?abc=123
**-- Object shortcuts (works for both JSON and querystring syntaxes):**
----- Key without a value: {abc} will be expanded to {abc: "abc"}
----- Key without a value, but with a special value alias postfix: {abc.} becomes {abc: true} and {abc!} is {abc: false}
----- Both keys and values will be parsed as potential variables, with the result of key parsing needing to be a string.
----- Recursion with a '.', for example myValue.level1.level2 will give "abc" if myValue is {level1: {level2: "abc"}}
**-- Live framework values:**
----- #cell will expand to the current value of the named cell: e.g. #myCell will give the current value of the cell named "myCell"
----- ~context will expand to the current value of named context variable: e.g. ~test will give the value of the context variable named "test"
----- Dot based recursion also works as expected for #cells and ~context variables: e.g. #myCell.abc.def or ~test.one.two.three both work fine.
----- @fields, labels and the "passed in value alias" of '$' are NOT supported in the command line environment because they are functionally meaningless in this context.

This is a basic overview to get you started. To explore specific commands and their usage, type $\`help [command]\` in the console. For example:
$`help show`
